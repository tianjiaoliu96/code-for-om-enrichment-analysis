# code-for-om-enrichment-analysis
The primary objective is to present and examine the characteristics and organization of a dataset which includes the parameters related to the OM enrichment. This will be achieved through a series of steps, including data preprocessing, parameter selection using NMDS, hyperparameter optimization of the t-SNE model, dimensionality reduction, and visualization. 
Step 1: Data collection and preprocessing, including removing data outliers and normalization. 
Step 2: NMDS analysis to select relevant parameters. 
Step 3: Optimization of t-SNE model hyperparameters. 
Step 4: Dimensionality reduction and visualization using t-SNE. 
Step 5: Comprehensive analysis of factors influencing OM enrichment.
